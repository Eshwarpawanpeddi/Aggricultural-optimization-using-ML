2. Click the big yellow **"Download Python 3.x.x"** button
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** at the bottom
5. Click **"Install Now"**
6. Wait for installation to complete

### Mac:
1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Step 2: Download Project Files

1. Create a new folder on your Desktop called `CropProject`
2. Download all project files (`.py`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.bat`, `.sh` files)
3. Place **ALL** files into the `CropProject` folder
4. Make sure these files are in the folder:
   - `app.py`
   - `index.html`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `config.py`
   - `start.bat` (Windows)
   - `start.sh` (Mac/Linux)
   - README files

---

## Step 3: Open Terminal/Command Prompt

### Windows:
- Press `Windows Key + R`
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- **OR** Search for "Command Prompt" in Start Menu

### Mac:
- Press `Command + Space`
- Type `Terminal` and press Enter
- **OR** Go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal

### Linux:
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`
- **OR** Search for "Terminal" in your applications

---

## Step 4: Navigate to Project Folder

Type this command (replace with your actual path):

**Windows:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\CropProject
```

**Mac:**
```bash
cd /Users/YourName/Desktop/CropProject
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cd /home/YourName/Desktop/CropProject
```

💡 **Tip:** You can drag the folder into the terminal window to auto-fill the path!

Press **Enter**

---

## Step 5: Install Required Packages

Copy and paste this command exactly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Press **Enter** and wait (this may take 2-5 minutes)

You'll see text scrolling—this is normal! Wait until it says "Successfully installed..."

## Step 6: Start the Application

### Option A: Easy Way (Double-Click)

**Windows:**
- Double-click `start.bat` in your project folder

**Mac/Linux:**
- Double-click `start.sh`
- If it doesn't work, continue to Option B

### Option B: Command Line Way

**Windows:**
```bash
python app.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Press **Enter**

You should see messages like:
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Running on http://localhost:5000
```

✅ **Success!** The server is running!

2. In the address bar, type exactly:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
3. Press **Enter**

🎉 **You should now see the Precision Crop Management Dashboard!**

1. **View Dashboard Metrics** - See soil moisture, temperature, NPK levels, crop health
2. **Control Irrigation** - Select a field, set duration and water volume, click "Start Irrigation"
3. **Monitor Fields** - View 4 pre-configured fields (Wheat, Corn, Soybeans, Rice)
4. **Check Forecasts** - See 7-day crop yield predictions in the chart
5. **View Alerts** - Check recommendations for field management
6. **Weather Forecast** - See 5-day weather predictions

Everything updates automatically every 30 seconds!

---

## 🛑 How to Stop the Application

1. Go back to the Terminal/Command Prompt window
2. Press `Ctrl + C` (on both Windows and Mac/Linux)
3. The server will stop
4. You can close the terminal window

---

## 🔄 How to Start Again

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to project folder (Step 4)
3. Run the command: `python app.py` (or `python3 app.py`)
4. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## ❗ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Python is not recognized..."
- **Problem:** Python not installed or not in PATH
- **Solution:** Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"

### "pip is not recognized..."
- **Problem:** pip not installed
- **Solution (Windows):** `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Solution (Mac/Linux):** `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "Port 5000 is already in use"
- **Problem:** Another application is using port 5000
- **Solution:** 
  - Windows: Open Task Manager, end any Python processes
  - Mac/Linux: Type `killall python` or `killall python3`

### "Cannot find requirements.txt"
- **Problem:** You're not in the correct folder
- **Solution:** Make sure you're in the project folder (Step 4)

### Page won't load in browser
- **Problem:** Server not running or wrong address
- **Solution:** 
  - Check terminal shows "Running on..."
  - Try `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead
  - Check for typos in the address

### "Module not found" errors
- **Problem:** Dependencies not installed properly
- **Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### Database errors
- **Problem:** Database file corrupted
- **Solution:** Delete `agriculture.db` file and restart the application
